Support for the research included in this thesis was provided through the US Department of Energy. 

The creation of this thesis, as well as my general progress through graduate school and development as a physicist, would not have been possible without the support of my advisor Dr. Jeremy Mans, who first introduced me to high energy physics research as an undergraduate student and to whom I am deeply grateful for his support over my decade here at the University of Minnesota.

I would also like to thank my fellow current and former graduate students, particularly Neil Schroeder, Zach Lesko, Josh Hiltbrand, Tom Eichlersmith, Bryan Crossman, Charlie Kapsiak, and Billy Jackson.
Further support in developing this analysis and revising this thesis was provided by Dr. Michael Krohn and Dr. Joe Muse, who provided valuable input at every stage of the process. 
Lastly, I would like to thank my family and friends for their support over the years, and for their distractions from physics which helped to keep me sane.
